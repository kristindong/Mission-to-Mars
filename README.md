# Mission-to-Mars

## Summary

In this Challenge, we used Splinter, BeautifulSoup, Flask, and MongoDB dependencies in Python to scrape Mars data from websites
- Splinter allows us to automate browser functions and collect the html data
- Next we parse the html data using Beautiful Soup
- We then store various non-relational data sets (tables, texts, dictionaries) in MongoDB
- Finally Flask allows us to scrape and present the data using a web interface
